# 🚀 Basic JavaScript Projects

This repository contains my **foundational JavaScript projects** built while learning core JavaScript concepts.  
Each project focuses on **logic building, DOM manipulation, and event handling** using plain (vanilla) JavaScript.

These projects are intentionally kept simple to strengthen fundamentals before moving to frameworks.
